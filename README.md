## Sephora Data Analysis Project
### Emily Nguyen

#### Project Description:

This project analyzes the Sephora dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about the products sold at Sephora, including the brand, category, price, and ratings. The analysis will answer the following three questions:

1. When predicting whether a product is out of stock or not, which model (Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting Tree) is better at determining stock availability?
2. Which features have the most significant impact on predicting the price of a product, and can we identify a subset of important features using LASSO regression?
3. When considering rating, size, and price, what clusters emerge, and what kind of products are in those clusters?
